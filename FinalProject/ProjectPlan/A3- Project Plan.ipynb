    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "   The subject of Racial and Ethnic disproportionality in US prisons has been analyzed and studied by many researchers. While a group of publications such as [1] draw attentions to this matter as a great concern and a sign of racial discrimination in US criminal justice system, the other group try to study the involvement rates and relate the racial disproportionality of certain races to higher arrest rates as an indicator of involvement and conclude that the distrust in the criminal justice system should be re-evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "     What we are going to focus on in this project however, is not the racial or ethnic disproportionality in the number of arrests or inmates, but more-specifically, in what way Racial vs Non-Racial characteristics affect the _type_ and _length of inmate sentences_ given the same offense category and whether or not we can observe a Racial/Ethnic disparity in that aspect. This specific metric, unlike the analysis of the number of prisoners, could be considered as an important indicator of discrimination in the criminal justice system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existing Work\n",
    "\n",
    "   Existing research on this subject such as [3], analyze the United States Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities (SISCF) data over a 1-year period, considering only the drug-related offenses. In our study, we are going to extend the previous research by expanding the time period to cover a broader time-range: from the existing data as early as 1970s to the latest available dataset in 2004. This approach will give us a sense on how the dynamics of criminal justice has been evolving over the past 30 years with respect to length and type of the sentences based on racial/non-racial characteristics of the inmates. Additionally, we will be expanding the offense categories to cover non-drug related offense types as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Research question\n",
    "\n",
    "   The main focus of this research is to ask whether or not race and ethnicity of inmates play a role in the length and type of the sentence they receive given. We then take this question further to compare its results among time ranges from 1970s to 2000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "   Based on existing literature, we hypothesize that Non-white races who are convicted for similar offense categories are being convicted to lengthier prison sentences and are given more indeterminate sentences rather than flat sentences when we compare to white inmates if we  control for other variables that may affect sentence length and type of sentence, specifically parole status prior to sentencing, plea agreement status, prior criminal history, education status prior to arrest, employment status prior to arrest, and parental incarceration[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "   We will apply the Binary Logistic Regression to each of our dependent variables: The _type_ and _length_ of the sentence given the year of the study as well as the race of inmates as independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The binary logistic regression is an appropriate statistical analysis when the independent variables (predictors) are continuous, discrete, or a combination of continuous and discrete.This analysis permits the evaluation of the odds of membership in one of the two outcome groups based on the combination of predictor variable values.  Evaluation of the logistic regression model includes the overall model evaluation and a classification table showing the percentage of correct predictions. The overall model significance for the binary logistic regression will be examined using the x2 omnibus test of model coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Binary logistic regression analysis, by design, overcomes many of the restrictive assumptions of linear regressions.  For example, linearity, normality and equal variances are not assumed, nor is it assumed that the error term variance is normally distributed.  The major assumption is that the outcome variable must be dichotomous.  There should be no multicollinearity among the independent variables, there should be no outliers, and there should be a linear relationship between the odds ratio and the independent variable.  Linearity with an ordinal or interval independent variable and the odds ratio can be checked by creating a new variable that divides the existing independent variable into categories of equal intervals and conducting the same regression on these newly categorized versions as categorical variables.  Linearity is shown if the _B_coefficients increase or decrease in linear steps[6].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "   We will be using a the United States Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities (SISCF) series of data, which has been gathered through surveys designed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and conducted by the Bureau of the Census. The surveys gathered extensive information on demographic, socioeconomic, and criminal history characteristics. These surveys provide nationally representative data on inmates held in state prisons and federally-owned and operated prisons. Through personal interviews conducted from 1974, including 1979, 1986, 1991, 1997 through 2004, inmates in both state and federal prisons provided information about their current offense and sentence, criminal history, family background and personal characteristics, prior drug and alcohol use and treatment programs, gun possession and use, and prison activities, programs, and services. These studies have been roughly taken place in 5-year rotations over a 30 year time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be combining the 7 different data-sets in this series to establish the unified dataset summarizing the 30 years history of the survey results in order to conduct our extended study over the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Human Centered Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "   The focus of this research is to study the behavioral bias when it comes to the degree of punishment which has a strong Human-Centered objective regardless of the results it may entail. The motivation for this work is rooted in un-covering the bias if it exists or help re-establish trust in the Criminal Justice system otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In conducting this research, we are heavily relying on Human-Centered approaches from working with data which is gathered respecting the right for privacy for instance [4] and [5] and at the same time protecting the data copy right and licensing information by citing the license information in references section of this report and any future report related to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Finally, we will be publishing our results as well as all the steps to reproduce and repeat them including code and methods used throughout this research, publically in the format of Jupyter Notebook on github.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations risks\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using the SISCF datasets, we are binding our results to the limitations and accuracy of sampling and comprehensiveness of the dataset and any hidden bias that might be inadvertently included while gathering the data which may put the accuracy of the study to a degree of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Another point to consider, is the sampling of data throughout the window of 30 years and the risk of missing out a lot of inter-polar data which could affect the accuracy of our study when it comes to considering the time when the data was gathered.\n",
